    "The model's $R^2$ is $0.599$, indicating that the independent variables \"growth\" and \"inflat\" explain $59.9%$ of the variance in the dependent variable \"vote\". The high $R²$ value indicates reasonable explanatory power.\n",

The corresponding null hypothesis t-value is $54.162$, rejecting the null hypothesis at a significance level of less than $1%$.

The corresponding null hypothesis t-value is $5.765$, rejecting the null hypothesis at a significance level of less than $1%$.

The corresponding null hypothesis t-value is $0.533$, and the corresponding p-value is $0.599$, indicating that we cannot definitively reject the null hypothesis.
